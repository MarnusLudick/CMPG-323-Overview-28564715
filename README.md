# How .gitignore files are used in my projects
 There will be 1 .gitignore file created for each repository individually, with a list of files that will be ingored and not tracked.
 
# How I ensure information and credentials are protected
 A security.md file will be created with Security Update Policies, Security Configurations, etc. For more protections there will be made use of git-secrets.
